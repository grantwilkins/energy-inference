/* An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard
rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info
interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of
bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is
then initialized to contain information for random number generation with
that much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state
information are 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by
calling the setstate() function with the same array as was initialized
with initstate().  By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state
information and generates far better random numbers than a linear
congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than
32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used.  Internally, the
state information is treated as an array of longs; the zeroth element of
the array is the type of R.N.G.. */

/* Order size using quicksort.  This implementation incorporates
   four optimizations discussed in Sedgewick:

   1. Non-recursive, using an explicit stack of pointer that store the
      next array partition to sort.  To save time, this maximum amount
      of space required to store an array of SIZE_MAX is allocated on the
      stack.  Assuming a 32-bit (64 bit) integer for size_t, this needs
      only 32 * sizeof(stack_node) == 256 bytes (for 64 bit: 1024 bytes).
      Pretty cheap, actually.

   2. Chose the pivot element using a median-of-three decision tree.
      This reduces the probability of selecting a bad pivot value and
      eliminates certain extraneous comparisons.

   3. Only quicksorts TOTAL_ELEMS / MAX_THRESH partitions, leaving
      insertion sort to order the MAX_THRESH items within each partition.
      This is a big win, since insertion sort is faster for small, mostly
      sorted array segments.

   4. The larger of the two sub-partitions is always pushed onto the
      stack first, with the algorithm then concentrating on the
      smaller partition.  This *guarantees* no more than log (total_elems)
      stack size is needed (actually O(1) in this case)!  */
